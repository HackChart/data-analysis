Questions like \"how many Pokemon are there?\" are easy to answer, but do little to actually provide insight on minutia of the dataset. Instead, if focusing on quantity, we might ask \"how many new Pokemon were created in each generation?\". If the numbers from generation to generation seem largely similiar, we might infer that the Pokemon company sets arbitrary numeric goals for the number of new pokemon that must be introduced with every sequential release. If this does happen to be the case, we could ask further questions like \"What is the distribution of typing in each release? Is it similiar? Could this effect the balance of power in the game?\" or, if not, could the distribution of typing per generation be based on the in-game environment? Does generation 7, which is set in an archipelago, contain higher number of water and ground type Pokemon than other generations? However, say the generational numbers vary widely, perhaps we could ask questions about the Pokemon company itself, such as \"For generations where fewer new pokemon were released, was the company's budget or timeline any different than generations with larger releases?\".  \n","  \n","These are the kinds of questions that grant us further insight into the nature of the games and the company behind their development. Howewer, before we can run, we must learn to walk, so, in the interest of learning basic navigation and analysis with the libraries involved, let's start with something more readily attainable.  \n","  \n","## Basic Questions\n","--- \n","- What is the strongest Pokemon in terms of overall stats?\n","- What is the most effective move typing?\n","    - Which is the least effective?\n","- Which Pokemon has the highest IV for:\n","    - Attack\n","    - Special Attack \n","    - Defense\n","    - Special Defense\n","    - Speed\n","    - HP\n","- Which typing has the highest average IV's for:\n","    - Attack\n","    - Special Attack\n","    - Defense\n","    - Special Defense\n","    - Speed\n","    - HP\n","- Which typing has the most Pokemon over 600 IV?\n","- Does typing have any bearing on IV's?\n","    - Do fire types have stronger than average special attack?\n","    - Do dragon types have stronger than average attack?\n","    - Do rock, ground, steel types have stronger than average defense?\n","- What single typing has the least amount of weaknesses?\n","- What single typing has the highest number of weaknesses?\n","- What about dual typings?
